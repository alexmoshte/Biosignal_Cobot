A robotic arm controlled using sEMG signals as the main control input parameter. Here I upload the PCB design files of the motor drivers, the MCU which controls the drivers and the DAQ that picks up the sEMG signals from the muscles.The DAQ has 6 channels intended to be used by two people concurently since one person utilises three channels. I also upload the firmware that I used to control the drivers and the DAQ. Documentation on how the project was implemented can also be found here.
