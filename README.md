My final year project. A collaborative robotic arm controlled by sEMG signals as the main control input parameter. Here I upload the KICAD PCB design files of the motor drivers, the MCU which controls the drivers, the DAQ that picks up the sEMG signals from the muscles and the documentation for the project
