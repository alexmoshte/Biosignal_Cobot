A robotic arm controlled using sEMG signals as the main control input parameter. Here I upload the PCB design files of the motor drivers, the MCU which controls the drivers and the DAQ that I used to pick up the sEMG signals from the muscles. I also upload the firmware that I used to control the drivers and the DAQ not forgetting the application code for the DSP algorithms I use on the DAQ to condition the sEMG signals. Documentation on how the project was implemented can also be found here.
